## 📘 What is **Daily Reading Streak (DRS)?**
**Daily Reading Streak (DRS)** is a lightweight web app designed to help users build consistent reading and writing habits.  
Inspired by **Duolingo’s day streak system**, it motivates you to log what you’ve read each day and reflect on your insights — turning small daily actions into a meaningful long-term habit.



## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Read something** — a book, article, or even a research paper.  
2. **Log it** — enter the title and write a short reflection (minimum 50 characters).  
3. **Submit your entry** — your first streak day begins!  
4. **Come back tomorrow** — log again after 12 AM to keep your streak alive.  



## 💡 Inspiration
While learning Russian on **Duolingo**, I was fascinated by how its streak system motivates users to return daily.  
That inspired me to design a **mock habit-building app** — one that nurtures daily reading and reflection instead of language learning.  
This project merges my passion for **habit formation, UI design, and personal development**.



## ✨ Key Features
- 🕒 **Daily Reading Log:** Record book titles and reflections to maintain your streak.  
- 📚 **Reading History:** Review up to 10 recent entries with date, title, and reflection.  
- 🔥 **Streak Tracker:** Automatically tracks and resets your daily streak.  
- 🎨 **Simple UI:** Clean, book-themed interface with responsive layout.  
- 🔒 **Privacy-Friendly:** All data stored locally using browser cookies.
