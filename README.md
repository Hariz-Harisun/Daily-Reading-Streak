# Daily-Reading-Streak
I just started using Duolingo recently because I want to learn Russian. I am amazed by the day streak system created by Duolingo. Most Duolingo users have a lot of day streaks! So much so that some of my friends have hundreds of day streaks! How does this Duolingo system succeed in developing a habit-building? This inspired me to develop a mock application, where this application is used to build a habit of reading books, as well as a habit of writing!
