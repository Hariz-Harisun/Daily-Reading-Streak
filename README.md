## What is `Daily Reading Streak (DRS)`?
`Daily Reading Streak (DRS)` is a mock application designed to help users build a consistent habit of reading books and writing reflections. Inspired by Duolingoâ€™s day streak system, this project encourages users to log their daily reading along with reflections, enabling them to track their progress and develop lasting reading habits.

## How `(DRS)` works?
- **Step 1:** Read anything that is useful for your knowledge or insight, whether it's from a book or a piece of paper.
- **Step 2:** Write down the title of what you've read and what you've learned from it.
- **Step 3:** Submit your entry.
- **Step 4:** Your streak for the first day is counted!
- **Step 5:** Repeat the process the next day (daily claim starts at 12 AM).


## Inspired from,
I just started using Duolingo recently because I want to learn the Russian language. I am amazed by the day streak system created by Duolingo. Most Duolingo users have a lot of day streaks! So much so that some of my friends have hundreds of day streaks! How does this Duolingo system succeed in developing a habit-building? This inspired me to develop a mock application, where this application is used to build a habit of reading books, as well as a habit of writing!

## Key Features:
- **Daily Reading Log:** Enter the book title and a reflection (minimum 50 characters) each day to maintain your streak.
- **Reading History:** View the last 10 days of reading logs, including the date, title, and reflection.
- **Streak System:** Tracks and displays your streak, resetting if a day is missed.
- **User Experience:** Clean book-themed interface and responsive design.
